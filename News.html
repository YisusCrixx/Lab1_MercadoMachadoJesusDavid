        <h1>Sony Reveals Aggressive Mobile Growth Plans for PlayStation, About 20% of Its Output Could Be on Mobile by 2025</h1>
        
        <p>Last year, Sony revealed that it is exploring the mobile market with “wonderful PlayStation franchises". Fast
        forward to today, we haven’t seen much of the results of that, but the company revealed in its corporate 
        strategy meeting under the Game and Network Services portion that it has aggressive growth plans for mobile 
        with a possibility of about 20% of its output being mobile by 2025. Sony also has plans to partner with
        respected, established, and successful mobile developers to extend franchises to more players and regions. It
        wants to remain faithful to the values of PlayStation, publish relevant external games, and also expand to
        cross-platform where relevant according to the slide. Over the years, we’ve already seen Sony’s own Journey,
        The Unfinished Swan, and more hit iOS through Annapurna Interactive. There are a few notable Sony titles
        that could be brought over to mobile already like Patapon or Loco Roco, but this will likely mean tie-in
        games or separate bespoke mobile releases. I hope we get a combination of both.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>The expanding to cross platform where relevant is interesting because it could mean some live service 
        games that likely come to PC, could also be on mobile. I’m certain Sony has seen how successful games 
        have been on mobile with cross platform play as well. Genshin Impact is only available on PlayStation 
        consoles outside mobile and PC as well as an example of a recent cross platform game that is very 
        successful. Sony also details how its first-party portfolio could have up to 20% of its output be 
        for mobile by 2025 with it growing through the next few years. Sony wants to go from console-centric
        to a future beyond the console for large elements of the community. Hopefully next year sees a proper
        MLB The Show game from Sony hit mobile as well since it is already on Nintendo Switch. We likely won’t
        see the same console game come to mobile, but a companion game that lets you earn things in the main 
        console game would be a start. Check out the full Sony presentation with the mobile and PC segments
        detailed here. What would you like to see from Sony and PlayStation Studios on mobile barring older 
        games ported over if that is being considered?</p>

        <h1>"Genshin Impact" Version 2.7 Pre-Installation Now Available on iOS, Android, and PC Ahead of Its Release Next Week</h1>
        
        <p>
        Genshin Impact (Free) version 2.7 update finally releases next week across all platforms following a bit of a delay. Developer 
        HoYoverse previously showcased Yelan in a new character trailer with details for the update being revealed a little while ago.
        If you missed that, version 2.7 ‘Hidden Dreams in the Depths’ brings a new Archon Quest in the Chasm unveiling Liyue and yaksha’s 
        history, reruns for Xiao and Arataki Itto, the Arataki gang hosting a drumalong rhythm game, and more. Today, Genshin Impact version 2.7
        pre-installation has gone live on iOS, Android, and PC platforms ahead of its May 31st release. As usual, this isn’t available on PS5 
        and PS4 and will be downloaded on the release date there next week. The Genshin Impact 2.7 pre-installation download size is 6.04GB on
        iOS and about 10GB on PC. Watch the Genshin Impact 2.7 Yelan character trailer below:

        <p>To pre-install Genshin Impact 2.7, load up the client on mobile and click the pre-install package icon on the bottom left of the title
        screen before you load into your character. On PC you need to update the launcher as well to see the pre-installation button. If you 
        haven’t checked out Genshin Impact yet, you can download it for free on the App Store for iOS here and on Google Play for Android here.
        The PC version is available on the official website here and the Epic Games Store. If you play on iOS, with iOS 14.5 or iPadOS 14.5 and 
        later, you can use PS5 and Xbox Series X|S controllers to play Genshin Impact. We featured Genshin Impact as our Game of the Week when it
        released and awarded it our 2020 Game of the Year. Have you been playing Genshin Impact recently and what do you want to see it bring this
        year?</p>
