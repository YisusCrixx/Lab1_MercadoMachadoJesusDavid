        <h1>Dying Light 2: Stay Human Review</h1>
        <h2 style="color: #59626f;">Packed with top-notch parkour, an awesome open world, and every painful bug in the book.
        </h2>

        <h2>Verdict</h2>

        <p>Another in a long series of big, ambitious games whose potential greatness is visible just beneath a 
        grimey layer of bugs, Dying Light 2 Stay Human could very likely become the stellar zombie survival 
        adventure it’s meant to be someday. For now, though, it’s best added to your backlog unless your irritation
        with crashes and technical issues is outweighed by eagerness to dance across rooftops with its excellent 
        parkour, which – when everything works – is an unforgettable way to explore the last city’s open world and
        join in the post-apocalyptic stories of its many weird and distinctive characters. No patch can fix the 
        forgettable main plot or the protagonist I couldn’t pick out of a police lineup even after 80 hours in his
        shoes, but Dying Light 2’s streets tell their own stories.</p>

        <h1>Insurgency: Sandstorm Review</h1>

        <h2 style="color: #59626f;">A military FPS that nails the balance between realism and fun.</h2>

        <div style="text-align: center">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlWWILcsIao" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" ></iframe>
        </div>

        <h2>Veredict</h2>

        <p>Insurgency: Sandstorm isn’t the prettiest shooter of 2018, but the places where it excels are the places
        that matter to me most as a player. Its gunplay is superb, its arsenal is exemplary, and (with the exception
        of the excellent Firefight) the maps and modes are serviceable enough to facilitate its memorably frantic and
        immersive FPS combat. I can’t wait to see where it goes in the future, but even as it stands now Insurgency:
        Sandstorm is a pleasant surprise that’s worthy of your time.</p>

        <h1>Ready or Not in review</h1>
        <h2 style="color: #59626f;"> The tactical shooter is not (yet) worthy of the great SWAT</h2>
        
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/LI0gxpt5u50" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" ></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Veredict</h2>
        <p>No test has been as difficult for me as the one for Ready or Not. Yes, the game is merely in the Early Access stage. Yes, the release was probably spontaneous and yes, publisher Team 17 bailed at short notice. These are all factors that certainly do not have a positive effect on the current quality of the game. On the other hand, the game has been very well received by fans and many critics. However, it is my job to evaluate the current state of a game and to fade out the circumstances as far as possible. Therefore, I have to say at this point – also in relation to what the game wants to be – that it is too little.
            It’s true that the core mechanics – working your way tactically through areas – work quite well in single and multiplayer, the gun battles are usually fun despite the frustrating accuracy of the enemies, and the graphics sometimes create coherent situations. But almost everything else permanently pulls me out of the game. Why can I equip my AI colleagues but not hand out gadgets? Why do I, as a special police unit, not receive a briefing on the basis of which I can coordinate my equipment? Why do the scenarios seem arbitrary and haphazard? Why do I start on an empty map without the scenery of a police operation? Why do I feel that there are only a handful of character models for enemies and civilians, when the developer’s claim is to create an organic world with individual characters? Why can’t I sprint in missions with a time limit? Why can I easily walk through windows, but grenades bounce off the glass?
            I, too, am one of the “starved” fans of SWAT & Co. Incidentally, I see this as one of the main reasons for the current success of Ready or Not. And the potential to become the expected hit is running out of Ready or Not’s ears left and right. And yet I find it hard to join in the ongoing hymns of praise. The fact that the game’s justly praised mechanics are severely underrepresented in the current gaming landscape is certainly a factor in Ready or Not’s success. Nevertheless, I have to say clearly that this mechanic does not yet work properly and much around it is either not yet finished or at best shows a perspective.
            For the sake of all the fans, and not least myself, I hope that development progresses well and that at some point we do indeed have a worthy heir to SWAT 4 in our hands with Ready or Not. Until then, I remain sceptical.
